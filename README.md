### Hi there 👋 
👋 Hi, I'm Jared! I'm a passionate frontend developer based in Asheville, NC, where the mountains are as inspiring as the code I write. 🏞️

With a keen eye for design and a strong understanding of user-centric development, I'm devoted to crafting interactive and responsive web experiences that users love. My toolbox includes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Vue.js, and more.

When I'm not typing away at my keyboard, you can find me exploring the beautiful trails of the Blue Ridge Mountains or diving into the local tech scene. I believe in lifelong learning and love sharing my knowledge with others, so feel free to reach out to me for any collaborative projects or coding discussions.

Let's transform the digital landscape together, one line of code at a time. 💻🚀
